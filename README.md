# Comfortable Testing Environment
Some natural features in Minecraft are annoying and distracting when testing plugins: `Storms`, `Phantoms`, etc.\
This plugin offers a simple config where you can disable and control all of those.

## Default Configuration
- `Storms` are disabled.
- `Phantoms`, `Wandering Villagers`, and `Llamas` can't spawn.
