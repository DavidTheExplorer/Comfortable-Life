# Comfortable Testing Environment
Some natural features in Minecraft are annoying and distracting when testing plugins.\
This plugin offers a simple config where you can either disable or control them.

## Default Configuration
- `Storms` are disabled.
- `Phantoms`, `Wandering Villagers`, `Slimes` and `Llamas` can't spawn.
